<h1>The Best Movies According to Benjamin</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of my adolescence.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Butterfly effect</h3>

<p>A movie which simply explains the consequences of time traveling in a way that involves dramatically, suspensefully and ethically the viewer. The one with Asthon Kutcher is the right, the other ones are boring.</p>

<h3>Hannibal</h3>

<p>This suspense movie involves you in the way the vilain is thinking and put you in situations where you are constantly quesitoning your moral principles. An exceptional vilain who deserves a detailed examination.</p>

<h3>Melody Fair</h3>

<p>This one is a very cliche romantic comedy of some boys turning to adolescents with a beatiful Bee Gees soundtrack. Mostly I found it entertained because I lack the type of adventures they show when I was their ages.</p>
